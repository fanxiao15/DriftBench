Ghatu dance is performed all over the central Himalayas by the Gurung, Magar, Dura, Balami and Kumal communities. This unique dance form tells the tragic story of King Pashramu and Queen Yambawati. Its a beautiful love story that has a tragic ending where the King dies and the grief-stricken Queen commits suicide. This dance performance takes place on the full moon day and the dancers are known as Ghatusaris. The dance is accompanied by the beat of the Madal. As the story unfolds during the dance routine, the dancers go into a trembling trance as they perform for hours. No one knows about the origin of this Dance form but it is speculated that this is a story about a local Chieftan and his wife. This dance form and its music has been passed down orally from one generation to another. Older women who once performed the Ghatu still go into a trance when they hear this music.
